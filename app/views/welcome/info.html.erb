			The vision behind this campaign is to raise awareness of corruption, arouse curiosity and challenge young peopleâ€™s attitude towards the topic. A corrupt act is to abuse the power entrusted in you for your own gain (definition by <a href="http://www.transparency.org/">Transparency International</a>), and it inflicts people in all corners of the world, of all ages. Corruption is not always easy to spot, as it is a complex phenomenon with many grey areas. With this campaign we hope to provide relevant and important information about corruption and shed light on the many different shades of it.
